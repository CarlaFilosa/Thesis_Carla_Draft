\textbf{Data acquisition.} Neural data was recorded with a 64-channel headstage (RHD2164) and interface board (RHD2000) by Intan Techonologiesm LLC at 30 kHz ampling frequency. The same interface was used to record stimulus onset and offset, reward application, licking activity and laser stimulation.\\
\textbf{Spike detection.} The median voltage trace of the corresponding brain region was subtracted from each recorded trace to reduce noise and movement artifacts affecting all recording sites. The result signal was bandpass-filtered between 300 and 500 Hz. A threshold value for spikes was computed as multiple (7.5x) of the median absolute deviation of the filtered signal ({\color{red}Quiroga 2004- vedere come citare})
