\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:Motivation}
Neuronal models of reinforcement learning assume interactions of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatum to compute the differences between anticipated and received outcomes (\cite{Schultz},\cite{Schultz1992},\cite{Schultz1995},\cite{Schultz1998},\cite{Schultz2001},\cite{Schultz2002},\cite{Fiorillo}). The nature of this cross-areal interaction is however not fully understood. On this purpose we recorded dual site simultaneous electrophysiological in-vivo data from Ventral Striatum, including Pallidum, (VS) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). On this data set we applied a cell assembly detection algorithm (\cite{RussoDurstewitz}).
The novel statistical approach presented treats the temporal scale and precision of coherent activity patterns as free parameters, to be determined from the data, thus, instead to make assumption, we deduced from data temporal scales and precision involved in assemblies pairs with units either from both regions or from only one of the two regions, shedding light on VS-VTA interaction temporal structure and VS-VTA directionality.
We can use the term directionality in our case because we use the algorithm at level of inter-regional pairs. It is important to recall that the cell-assembly algorithm returns lags between the units activation in assembly, thus using the algorithm at level of inter-regional pairs provides us the lag between two units activation, of those two units one is in VS and another in VTA, a lag in activation of such kind of pair, indicates which region is preceding the other in activation.
Our nomenclature was such that a positive lag means that VS is prior in activation, a negative lag, vice-versa, means that VTA is preceding the activation of VS.
Taking advantage of well defined neuron typologies classifications both in VS and VTA, we further investigated the specific cell-type composition of the assemblies exhibiting directionality.

\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:StateArt}
 In recent decades Ventral Striatum and Ventral Tegmental area have been widely studied by scientists because of their prediction coding feature.
 To introduce the study on VS-VTA interaction an overview on the state of the art of the Ventral Striatum and Ventral Tegmental area knowledge is needed.
\section{Experiment and data set}
\label{sec:Dataset}
In this session we describe the experiment and the collected data for the analysis in object in this work. The experiment and the single units classification was conducted by Max Scheller, medical student, member of the Kelsch group.\\
The task presented is a go/no-go reversal odor discrimination task (see details in \hyperref[sec:MatAndMet]{~Section\ref*{sec:MatAndMet}}). In fig.\ref{fig:experiment} the scheme of the experimental set-up. Dual-site in-vivo data were recorded in Ventral Striatum and Ventral Tegmental Area, while two odors were presented to head-fixed mice, one rewarded (CS+) with reward probability 0.9, the second one unrewarded (CS-). Learning the task consisted in licking at least a defined number of times (two or three depending on the paradigm) during a specific interval, called lick window, when the rewarded odor (CS+) was presented (hit trials) and not licking when unrewarded odor (CS-) was presented (correct rejection trials). Whereas a bad performance consisted in not licking, or licking outside the lick window period, at CS+ presentation (miss trials), or licking at CS- presentation (false alarm trials). Once the performance criterion was reached, the contingencies were switched, in other words the rewarded odor became unrewarded and vice-versa. Once the performance criterion was reached in the reversal phase the extinction phase followed, in which neither one of the two odors was rewarded. The lick window was open for an interval ranging from 1500 $ms$ to 2000 $ms$ depending of different paradigms. after a delay from 500 $ms$ to 1500 $ms$. Only licks happening in the lick window interval were counted as valid to get the reward.\\

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:MatAndMet}
\subsection{Data acquisition}Neural data was recorded with a 64-channel headstage (RHD2164) and interface board (RHD2000) by Intan Technologies LLC at 30 kHz sampling frequency. The same interface was used to record stimulus onset and offset, reward application, licking activity and laser stimulation.

%\subsection{Method}

\subsection{Behavioral conditioning in the go/no-go task.} We trained the animals in the head-fix setup described above. Mice received water in their home cage so that their body weight stabilized at 85$\%$ of baseline body weight. The training comprised multiple stages and progressed after reaching a performance criterion defined as at least 80$\%$ correct responses in 50 consecutive trials. Trials were considered correct if either at a $'$go$'$-response the reward was retrieved or at a $'$no-go$'$-response no significant licking was detected during the lick window. In the initial sessions, the animals’ licking behavior was shaped by first presenting them with a drop of water and subsequently letting them obtain more water when they licked at the licking spout (available in a random interval schedule, 0.5-12 s). Stage 1 ($'$training$'$): A single odorant (1.5 s stimulus duration) was presented. Animals could obtain a 5 $\mu l$ drop of water if they licked at least three times during a window from 0 to 2.5 s after stimulus onset (‘retrieval window’), this was considered a $'$go$'$-response. The interval between trials was randomly set at $10\pm 2$ s in all stages. Stage 2 ($'$discrimination$'$) consisted of two odorants in pseudo-random succession (no more than 3 consecutive trials with the same stimulus). One odorant (1.5s duration) was rewarded as in stage 1 (retrieval window: 0.5 – 2.5 s), while a $'$go$'$-response for the second odorant was registered as a false alarm and thus incorrect. No punishment was used. Stage 3 ($'$reversal learning$'$) used the same parameters as stage 2, but upon reaching the performance criterion (in the $'$original phase$'$), the reward contingency of the odors was switched ($'$reversal phase$'$). The data set used in this study consists of one reversal learning session per animal (10 sessions with a total yield of 75 single units) after we accustomed them gradually to a longer lick delay (1.5 – 3 s), keeping odorant delivery concurrent (3 s duration). 

\subsection{Data pre-processing: Spike detection.} To reduce noise and movement artifacts affecting all recording sites, we subtracted the median voltage trace of all channels from each recorded trace. The resulting signal was band pass filtered between 300 and 5000 Hz (4th order Butterworth filter, built-in MATLAB function). A threshold value for spikes was computed as a multiple (7.5x) of the median absolute deviation of the filtered signal (\cite{Quiroga}). Temporally proximal detected peaks over threshold were pruned by height to a minimum distance of 1 ms to avoid multiple detections of the same multiphasic spike. When an event was detected on multiple channels of a tetrode, the timestamp of the highest detected peak was used. Spike waveforms were extracted around $-10$ to $+21$ samples around the peak.

\subsection{Data pre-processing: Spike sorting.} Spike sorting was done with a custom-built graphical user interface in MATLAB, originally developed by A. Koulakov (CSHL). Metrics used for clustering included detected peak height or amplitude (and the respective principal components over channels), and the first three principal components of the waveforms for each respective channel when a spike was predominantly recorded on one channel. The quality of single unit clusters was assessed using the mlib toolbox by Maik Stuettgen (Vs. 6, $\href{https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37339-mlib-toolbox-for-analyzing-spike-data}{MLIB-toolbox-for-analyzing-spike-data}$) with particular attention to peak height distribution (fraction of lost spikes due to detection threshold), contamination (fraction of spikes during the refractory period $<5ms$) and waveform variance.\\
%For analysis of the silicon probe data, spike detection and spike sorting was done using KiloSort (\cite{Pachitariu}), followed by manual curation with Phy (\href{https://github.com/kwikteam/phy}{KiloSort}) using similar parameters to assess unit quality.\\
\subsection{Data pre-processing: Inclusion criteria of units.} For further analyses, units were only included if they complied with a set of criteria: Throughout the analyzed part of the recording session units were allowed to only have a maximum change in baseline firing rate from beginning to the end of the session of less than ten percent and intermittent maximum fluctuations of 20$\%$.\\ After exclusion of the first ten trials of odorant application where we frequently observed an initial response habituation, both odor responses had to be stable throughout the $'$pre$'$ phase.\\
\subsection{Probe Design}
Given the relatively high distance ($>6 mm$) between sites, depth of the target structures ($>5 mm$) and curvature of the OT/VP,  we developed a probe design specifically attuned to these challenges and easily adaptable to different single- or multi-site configurations. A detailed tutorial for the streamlined successor version of the implant used here is in preparation. The design exploits the high precision of the mature production technology of printed circuit boards (PCB)  ($\pm10\mu m$, custom-designed boards ordered from Wuerth Electronics) to achieve a precise x-y-placement of the guiding channels for optical fibers (Thorlabs \#) and tetrodes (spun from $12.5 \mu m$ teflon-coated tungsten wire, California Fine Wire).  For the VTA, four tetrodes were attached to an optical fiber and fixed in their guiding channel.  For the OT/VP, the implant was placed above a mould of the ventral brain surface, and tetrodes and an optical fiber were advanced to their z-position and fixed in place, matching the bowl-shaped 3d-curvature of the OT (see pictures). Single tetrode wires were attached to the PCB using gold pins (Neuralynx). The connection between PCB and head stage was made via a Molex SlimStack connector (mated height: 1 mm, pitch: 0.4 mm, 70 channels, \# $502426-7030$) and an custom adaptor to the 2x36 Omnetics Nano Strip connectors of the Intan RHD2164 head stage.\\

\subsection{Animals and surgery details}
18 adults mice(DAT:Cre$+$, ChR2:YFP$+$ )(5-6 months aged) were implanted. The surgery duration was less than 2 hours, after which mice were housed individually. The recovery period was one week.\\
After termination of the experiments, animals were deeply anaesthetized with isofluorane and transcardially perfused with [x$\%$] formaldehyde solution. Placement of tetrodes in the target areas was evaluated post mortem by first explanting the whole brain, dorsal skull and attached probe as a unit, documenting the ventral aspect, where tetrode tips could be seen through the surface of the OT (foto\ref{fig:surgery}, left), and, in some cases, breaching it (foto\ref{fig:surgery}, right). After that, the relevant hemisphere was sectioned ($100 \mu m$) sagitally with a microtome (model \#) and mounted serially, so tetrode tracks could be traced.
