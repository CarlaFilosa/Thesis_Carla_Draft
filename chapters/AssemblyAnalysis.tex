\chapter{Cell assemblies analysis}
\label{chap:AssemblyAnalysis}
In this chapter I present the assemblies analysis conducted on the data set presented in \autoref{chap:Dataset}, using the cell assemblies algorithm and the single units classification respectively presented in \autoref{chap:AssemblyMethod} and \autoref{chap:UnitsAnalysis}.
The algorithm is free to detect any spike pattern coordination at any time scales.
Applying the cell-assembly algorithm we were able to detect synchronous ($lag=0$) and asynchronous ($lag\neq 0$) cell assemblies at arbitrary time scale ($\Delta$). 
Since we were interested in cross areal interactions an directionality between Ventral Striatum and Ventral Tegmental Area, I focus in this work on the inter-regional assembly-pairs. Inter-regional assembly-pairs means assemblies formed by two neurons, one neuron in Ventral Striatum and one neuron of Ventral Tegmental area. This is  an intuitive way to study the directionality between two regions: at pairs-level in fact, the lag in activation between units in assembly (one outcome of the cell assembly algorithm) indicates the lag in activation between the two regions of concern. In our nomenclature a positive lag ($lag>0$) means that the VS unit is preceding in activation the VTA unit: VS is leading and VTA is following; while a negative lag ($lag<0$) means that the VTA unit is preceding the activation of the VS unit: we can say that VTA is leading and VS is following. 

\section{Cell types occurrence}
Using the units classification, inter-regional pairs were classified according to underlying cell types. Classified and not classified units occurred in the two regions as shown in fig. (\ref{fig:PieAssembliesTot} (top)). The inter-regional pairs formed by those units occurred as is shown in pie-chart in fig. (\ref{fig:PieAssembliesTot} (bottom)). We can see that, selecting only classified units, four assemblies types occurs more often than other, they are pairs formed by fast spiking and gabaergic neurons ($20\%$), striatal projection neurons and dopaminergic neurons ($18\%$), fast spiking and dopaminergic units ($13\%$) and striatal projecton and gabaergic units ($9\%$). To see whether assembly types occur by chance or there is a relationship between the unit type activated in one region and the resulting assembly pairs, Pearson's $\chi^2$ test were conducted. Specifically, given the pairs types occurrence, we hypothesize a preference by fast spiking neurons for gabaergic neurons (and/or vice-versa) and a preference by striatal projecton neurons for dopaminergic neurons (and/or vice-versa). The $\chi^2$ test were performed on the directional pairs ($lag\neq0$) and separately on $vs\rightarrow vta$ ($lag>0$) and $vs \leftarrow vta$ ($lag<0$). In both cases, the $\chi^2$ test revealed a dependence between the unit-type and the resulting inter-regional pairs. The p-values of $\chi^2$ test were significant at the confidence level $\alpha = 0.05$. In direction $vs\rightarrow vta$ $p=2\times10^{-4}$ ($p=4\times10^{-4}$ using Yates correction), in direction $vs \leftarrow vta$: $p=9\times10^{-3}$ ($p=0.017$ using Yates correction). In tables (\ref{tab:chisquare_vsvta} and \ref{tab:chisquare_vtavs}) are shown the contingency tables of the $\chi^2$ tests for the two directionalities. In rows the activated cell types of the leading region, in columns the coupled selected cell types of the follower region. In the tables are shown the number of pairs between the two cell-types and in brackets $()$ the expected values. Both in $vs\rightarrow vta$ and in $vs\leftarrow vta$ directionality the real value of couples $SPN+DAN$ and $FSN+GABA$ exceed the expected value as we hypothesized. Those preference does not depend on directionality.

\section{Cross areal interactions time scales}
In this chapter a study on time scales involved in cross-areal interactions is presented. From the bimodal temporal scale ($\Delta$) distribution of cross-areal interaction emerges a segregation in two time scales for cross-areal interaction (figure (\ref{fig:BinDistr})).
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
This segregation is typical of inter-regional pairs, in fact a comparison with intra-regional pairs in Ventral Striatum and Ventral Tegmantal area show interesting differences.
While we observed assemblies of temporal precision at the scale of few tens of milliseconds only within either VS or VTA, assemblies of lower temporal precision were detected across VS-VTA units. The temporal precision of this last group displayed a bimodal distribution with peaks around $80$ milliseconds and one $1.6$ second, revealing the presence of two time scales, the first, preciser, ranged from 10 $ms$ to 250 $ms$, and the second including broader bin sizes. Intra-regional VTA-VTA pairs instead don't present any peak in time scales distribution. Intra-regional VS-VS bin size distribution is peaked around 50 $ms$. In VS we noticed differences between SPN and high-firing-rate SPN pairs and SPN and low-firing-rate FSN bin size distributions: specifically the firsts show higher temporal precision than the latter. {\color{red}{Include Figure of SPN -FSN and caption of bin size distribution}}.
\section{Directionality} 
The considerations above on the time scales distribution led us to study separately lag distribution of VS-VTA pairs detected in preciser and broader temporal scales highlighted from bin sizes distribution. We divided then these two assemblies population for the further study of directionality.
Interestingly lag distribution of precise and broad time scales are both asymmetric, indicating that the VS activation leads the activation of the VTA neuron (fig. \ref{fig:LagInSecAll}). The two distribution show however remarkable differences: broader time scales pairs show a fat-long tailed distribution, whereas precise time scales lag distribution.
Focusing our study on the more precise inter-regional pairs, we observed that specifically, the directional assemblies were composed of striatal and pallidal projection neurons leading dopaminergic VTA neurons (MSN and Type I pairs). Importantly, inter unit activation lags of assemblies containing pallidal neurons (FSI) were shorter than those containing striatal projection neurons (MSN), compatibly with assumed connectivity.

On bottom raster plot and firing rate (mean and standard deviation) of units in assembly. x-axis origin correspond to the odor onset, while the red line marks the end of the stimulus duration. The examined assembly has a positive lag, that means VS preceding in activity VTA, from neuronal activity we can see in fact the VS unit activate before than the VTA unit. The assembly was detected with a bin size of $0.25 sec$, meaning that we are in the small temporal scale domain, in which the directionality clearly emerged. From the raster plot is evident that this kind of activation was persistent in each trial, in fact that assembly showed a significant task related activity after the stimulus. In term of assembly coding capability it is interesting to note the different activation for paired odor trials and unpaired odor trials, revealing the odor discrimination capability of the assembly.

Bin width and lags analysis reveals time scale segregation, that can reveal in turn different assembly-activation patterns. In fig.(\ref{fig:AsActBinLag}) heat maps of assembly activity, detected in a particular paradigm, show differences in activation patterns among different bin width and lag. %% In the paradigm in examination animals were well-trained, it was the third time that the same couple of odor were presented with the same stimulus duration length.

\section{Conclusion}
From the inter-regional time precision distribution (bin size $\Delta$) we deduced that VS-VTA interactions are two time scales interactions. Looking at the assembly activity patterns we observed a dissection between the more precise time scale and the broader time scale inter-regional pairs. 
With the lags between units activation we have distinguished three types of assemblies: synchronous, positive directional and negative directional assemblies. From lag distributions one deduces that precise and broad time scale pairs show directionality in the direction of VS leading VTA.
Directional assemblies are formed by Striatal Projection Neurons and Dopaminergic Neurons.
Does directional assemblies show a different coding features with respect to other assemblies types?
To address this question we first investigate the assemblies task related pattern.
  
 \section{Differences among assemblies types}
 
 %%First difference between original and reversal phase is number of assemblies responding during the post-stimulus interval, this number decrease for all the typologies involved during hit trials (as shown in fig. (\ref{fig:histo_taskrel})), in according to the intuition, in reversal phase in fact, when the animals became more expert, neuronal response tend to be shifted closer to the reward delivery. This effect can be seen in fig. (\ref{fig:NeusInAsse}) where activity and raster plots of two units in a pair are shown. Looking at the raster plots, a shift in correspondence to the phase-switch is evident in both units.

%\section{Discussion}
%\section{Combination of single neuron and assemblies analysis}
%\subsection{Directionality using classification}
%\subsection{Significant task related response for typology}
To better study assemblies activation patterns, first the task relevant moments of the experiment were selected. From the mean task related activity patterns we expected to see differences among assemblies types in two experimental chapters (original and reversal). To better visualize the task related activation patterns via heat plots, hit trials (rewarded odor, mouse went for reward), correct rejection trials (unrewarded odor, mouse sat quiet), false alarm trials (unrewarded odor, mouse went for reward), were kept separated; however this separation among trials types was released in further analysis, without affecting results.
The assemblies were pruned according their significant task related activity, that was tested with Friedman's test and a non parametric version of the repeated measures Anova. We preferred to use non-parametric tests to be free from the assumption of gaussianity of the observations. Results of the two tests were consistent each other. The two relevant events of the task were the odor onset and the reward delivery, then we choose whether the assemblies showed a significant activity in three windows: Stimulus [0s, 0.5s], Pre-Reward [-0.5s, 0s], Reward [0s, 05s], the baseline was chosen in the interval [-1s, -0.5s] from the odor onset. Post-hoc analysis were performed using the Bonferroni's criterion {\color{red}check whether the criterion was Bonferroni of some other}. Almost $80\%$ of the VS-VTA assemblies showed a task related activity significant different from the baseline or from another of the windows considered. Of the significant assemblies $\%$ were composed by MSN-Type I units, $\%$ by FSI low-Type I, $\%$ by FSI high-Type I, $\%$ MSN-Type II, $\%$ by FSI low-Type II, $\%$ by FSI high-Type II, the other possible units combinations constitutes a minority and all toghether were the $\%$ {\color{red} Insert numbers of percentage}.
