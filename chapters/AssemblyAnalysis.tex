\chapter{Cell assembly analysis}
\label{chap:AssemblyAnalysis}
In this chapter we present the assembly analysis conducted on the data set introduced in \hyperref[chap:Dataset]{Chapter~\ref*{chap:Dataset}}, using the cell assembly detection algorithm and the single units classification presented in \hyperref[chap:AssemblyMethod]{Chapter~\ref*{chap:AssemblyMethod}} and \hyperref[chap:UnitsAnalysis]{Chapter~\ref*{chap:UnitsAnalysis}} respectively.\\
The cell assembly detection algorithm is designed to detect any coordinated spike trains patterns at any time scale. The time scales are explored running over different bin-widths. Further we examined the lag distribution. Lags describe the temporal distance in activation between units in assembly. Applying the cell-assembly algorithm we detected synchronous ($lag=0$) and asynchronous ($lag\neq0$) cell assemblies at arbitrary time scale ($\Delta$).\\
We were interested in cross areal interactions and directionality between Ventral Striatum (VS) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA).  Inter-regional assembly-pairs are assemblies formed by two neurons, of which one neuron is located in  the VS and the other one in VTA. At the pair-level, the lag in activation between units in assembly indicates the lag in activation between the two regions. A positive lag ($lag>0$) indicates that the VS unit is preceding in its activation the VTA unit, or in other words: VS is leading and VTA is following. A negative lag ($lag<0$) means that the VTA unit is preceding the activation of the VS unit, hence VTA is leading and VS is following.
\section{Cell types occurrence}
Based on the unit classification (\hyperref[chap:UnitsAnalysis]{Chapter~ \ref*{chap:UnitsAnalysis}}), inter-regional assembly were classified according to their underlying cell-types (fig.\ref{fig:PieAssembliesTot} (B.)).
Comparing the two pie charts related to the VS region, one observes fast spiking neurons (FSN) occur in inter-regional pairs more often than striatal projection neurons (SPN) (fig.\ref{fig:PieAssembliesTot} (B.-left)), even though recorded FSN are less than recorded SPN (fig.\ref{fig:PieAssembliesTot} (A.-left)).
\label{sec:CellTypesOcc}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{(A.) Occurrence of classified and not classified units in VS and VTA. (B.) Occurrence of classified and not classified units of VS and VTA in inter-regional assembly-pairs. In VS, FSN occur in inter-regional pairs more often than SPN, even though more SPN than FSN were recorded.(C.) Pie charts of assemblies types. Not indicated percentage are $<1\%$. Missing pieces of cake indicates pairs that include not classified units. The four more represented inter-regional pairs, including only classified units, are pairs between fast spiking and gabaergic neurons ($20\%$), striatal projection neurons and dopaminergic neurons ($18\%$), fast spiking and dopaminergic units ($13\%$) and striatal projection and gabaergic units ($9\%$). }
    \label{fig:PieAssembliesTot}
\end{figure}
We hypothesize that the formation of inter-regional asemblies  depended on the cell-types; to verify this hypothesis we conducted for each of the two regions a Pearson's $\chi^2$ test. Of the classified unit types, only the ones detected at sufficient frequencies could tested for reasons of statistical power: namely putative striatal projection neurons (pSPN) and fast spiking neurons (FSN) in VS, and dopaminergic and gabaergic units in VTA. Only few striatal cholinergic interneurons and VTA glutamatergic units were detected are poorly represented in the examined data-set, and in the entire work and therefore not amenable to statistical analysis. We therefore focused on the four most prominent neuron types and the cell assembly pairs formed between those units.\\Whether the recorded unit may or may not be part of an inter-regional pair is described  in the contingencies tables \ref{tab:chi2_asnotasVS}, \ref{tab:chi2_asnotasVTA}. In the contingencies tables, the number (compared to the expected values indicated in parentheses) of specific cell types in inter-regional pairs were reported with $\chi^2$ statistic p-values. For each test the $\alpha$ significance level was fixed at $0.05$, unless otherwise specified.

\end{table}
A relationship between unit types and inter-regional pairs formation was found only in VS. In VS the $\chi^2$ statistic value is 45.13 (44.12 using Yates correction), that gives a p-value of $1.8\times10^{-11}$ ($3.1\times10^{-11}$).{\color{red}{The result confirms our hypothesis that neuron-type in VS effects the formation of inter-regional assembly-pairs. Rephase!!!!!!!}}\\A similar test was conducted in VTA, with a resulting $\chi^2$ statistic of $3.62$ and a p-value of $0.057$, not significant at $\alpha = 0.05$ level. We therefore conclude that in VTA different neuron-types had more equal probabilities to form inter-regional pairs.\\
 We have shown above how often VS and VTA units occur in assemblies. We next analyzed if specific inter regional pair-types occur systematically more often than others. The occurrence of assembly-types for the recorded units is shown in the pie-chart of fig.\ref{fig:PieAssembliesTot} (bottom). Not indicated percentages are $< 1\%$.  Missing pieces of cake indicates pairs that include not classified units. Selecting only classified units, four assemblies types occurred more often than other, they were pairs formed by fast spiking and gabaergic neurons (20$\%$), striatal projection neurons and dopaminergic neurons (18$\%$), fast spiking and dopaminergic units (13$\%$) and striatal projection and gabaergic units (9$\%$).\\
To see whether assembly types occur by chance and whether there is a relationship between the unit type activated in one region and the resulting assembly pairs, again a Pearson's $\chi^2$ test was conducted. Specifically, given the relative frequency of certain types of assemblies, we hypothesize a preference for fast spiking neurons with gabaergic neurons (and/or vice-versa) and a preference for striatal projection neurons with dopaminergic neurons (and/or vice-versa). The $\chi^2$ test were performed on the directional pairs ($lag\neq0$) and separately on $VS\rightarrow VTA$ ($lag>0$) and $VS\leftarrow VTA$ ($lag<0$). In both cases, the p-values of $\chi^2$ test were significant at the confidence level $\alpha = 0.05$, thus the $\chi^2$ test confirmed a dependence between the cell-type and the resulting inter-regional assembly pair. In direction $VS\rightarrow VTA$ the p-value was $2\times10^{-4}$ ($p=4\times10^{-4}$ using Yates correction), in direction $VS\leftarrow VTA$: $p=9\times10^{-3}$ ($p=0.017$ using Yates correction). The contingency and the results of the $\chi^2$ tests are shown for the two directionalities in tables \ref{tab:chisquare_vsvta} and \ref{tab:chisquare_vtavs}. The activated cell types of the leading region are indicated in the rows,  the coupled selected cell types of the follower region in the columns. In the table-cells the number of pairs between the two cell-types and in brackets the expected values. Both in $VS\rightarrow VTA$ and in $VS\leftarrow VTA$ directionality the real values of couples $SPN+DAN$ and $FSN+GABA$ exceed the expected values.\\

\section{Cross-/intra- area interactions time scales}
\label{sec:TimeScales}
In the previous session we have seen that in Ventral Striatum the neuronal occurrence in assembly depends on the cell-types, and specifically pallidal units (FSN) occur more in assembly than striatal projection units. Furthermore we have seen that, in directional assembly, the combination among cell types is non-random, rather cell types prefer specific cell types to form inter-regional pairs.
With these analysis we exhaustively described the cell types occurrence in Ventral Striatum-Ventral Tegmental Area interactions.\\Time scales involved in the cross-area interactions remained to be examined and are argument of this chapter, together with a comparison with intra-area interaction time scales.\\
Detecting assemblies at any time scale, the detection algorithm dissect the time scales involved in pairs-interactions. A set of bin widths $\Delta \in \{\Delta_{min}...\Delta_{max}\}$ is provided as input, so that spike patterns can be detected at different bin-size, pairs are tested at all possible bin widths, then for each assembly, the width $\Delta^*$ associated with the lowest p-value may be defined as its characteristic temporal precision (see \hyperref[chap:AssemblyMethod]{Chapter~ \ref*{chap:AssemblyMethod}}).
In figure \ref{fig:BinDistr} is shown the temporal scale ($\Delta$) distribution of VS-VTA pair-interactions.
In figures \ref{fig:BinDistrVS} and \ref{fig:BinDistrVS} are shown VS-VS and VTA-VTA time-scale interactions distribution respectively.\\

\caption{VTA-VTA temporal scale distribution does not present any peak.}
\label{fig:BinDistrVTA}
\end{figure}
A comparison among inter-regional pairs (VS-VTA pairs) and intra-regional pairs (VS-VS pairs and VTA-VTA pairs) show interesting differences, that we are going to analyse.\\
While we observed assemblies of temporal precision at the scale of few tens of milliseconds only within either VS or VTA, assemblies of lower temporal precision were detected across VS-VTA units. Inter-regional VS-VTA interactions have a bimodal time-scales distribution with peaks around 80 $ms$ and one 1.6 $sec$, revealing two time scales involved in VS-VTA interaction, the first, more precise, ranged from 10 $ms$ to 250 $ms$, and the second including broader bin sizes; from which we consequently argue a complex interaction circuit effect, reflecting in inter-regional pairs.\\Bimodality is a characteristic specific of VS-VTA interactions, not present in VTA-VTA, or VS-VS interactions: intra-regional VTA-VTA pairs do not present any peak in time scales distribution, whereas intra-regional VS-VS bin size distribution is peaked around 50 $ms$.  
\subsection{SPN-FSN time scales interactions *}
\label{sec:SPN-FSN_Bin}
Fast spiking neurons population has broad firing rate, and according to the firing rate, sub-populations of the neurons classified as fast spiking neurons in first place can show different characteristic in terms of time-scales and length of interactions, or/and feature coding ({\color{red}ask for paper to cite}).\\From the distribution of mean firing rate of the recorded FSN was possible to define two sub-populations, those last do not present different characteristic when their units are coupled in assembly with a VTA neuron, however it worth to mention them in relation to their time-scales interactions with SPN. We report in figure \ref{fig:FSNsFireHisto} the histogram of FSNs mean firing rate, from which is possible to distinguish two sub-populations, that we will call FSNs low and FSNs high: the first characterized to have mean firing rate below $45 Hz$ and the latter has mean firing rate equal or above $45 Hz$.\\
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/FSNFiringRateLightDark.pdf}
    \caption{Histogram of FSNs mean firing rate. We can distinguish two populations of FSNs: FSN low-firing-rate population (FSN-low), that are light grey in the graph, characterized by having a firing rate below 45 $Hz$, and FSN high-firing-rate population (FSN-high), in dark grey, characterized by having a firing rate from 45 $Hz$ upwards.}

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/SPN_FSNhigh1.pdf}
    \caption{SPN-FSN-high pairs are almost exclusively detected at very precise time scales, namely from 10 $ms$ to 50 $ms$.}
    \label{fig:SPN_FSNhighBin}
\end{figure}
In VS we noticed differences between SPN-FSN-low pairs and SPN-FSN-high bin size distributions. SPN-FSN-low bin distribution pair is peaked at 50 $ms$, and another good portion of those pairs is detected at the two next bin sizes after the peak, 80 $ms$ and 120 $ms$ (fig. \ref{fig:SPN_FSNlowBin}); whereas SPN-FSN-high pairs are essentially only detected at more precise temporal scale (fig.\ref{fig:SPN_FSNhighBin}).\\We conclude that those two pair-types give a specific contribution to the global VS-VS temporal scale distribution. The variety of time scales involved in intra- or cross- area interactions in the studied regions emphasizes the complexity of the interaction circuit.
\section{Directionality} 
\label{sec:Directionality}
We had found in \hyperref[sec:TimeScales]{Section~\ref*{sec:TimeScales}} that inter-regional interactions have two characteristic time scales, which led us to consider more precise ($\Delta \in [0.01,0.25] ms$) and broader ($\Delta \in [0.25,0.6] ms$) VS-VTA pairs separately in the further study of directionality.\\We recall that one of the output of the cell-assembly algorithm is the inter-units activation lag of the assembly and, when we restrict the investigation to inter-regional pairs, the lag value tells us the distance in activation between the two region while the sign of the lag indicates the direction of the activation, namely which region became activated first and which one follows.\\
In fig.\ref{fig:LagInSecAll} we show the lag distribution for detected inter-regional pairs in the two characteristic time scales of interaction. As indicated in the plot, positive lag means VS is functionally leading the VTA activation and negative lag indicates the opposite direction.\\Interestingly lag distributions of precise and broad pairs are asymmetric, indicating that preferentially the VS activation leads the activation of the VTA. The two lag distributions show however remarkable differences: the lag distribution of broader pairs is fat-long tailed, that means a good portion of pairs detected with long activation lag ($lag > 1 sec$), whereas preciser pairs lag distribution has thin tails: almost all pairs detected in precise time scale have short lag ($|lag| < 1 sec$), and a good portion of pairs is detected within a lag value of 0.5 $sec$.\\
We focused the study on the more precise temporal scale, in such a way that temporal scale interactions were separated to typical task-related time scales, as e.g. the length of the odor duration, which cover typically an interval from 1.0 $sec$ to 1.5 $sec$.\\
We observed that, the directional assemblies are composed of striatal projection neurons leading dopaminergic neurons (SPN-DAN pairs), all the other pair-types do not show a clear preferred directionality. Furthermore, inter-unit activation lags of assemblies containing pallidal neurons (FSN) were shorter than those containing striatal projection neurons (SPN), compatibly with assumed connectivity. In fig.\ref{fig:LagInSec4typo} is shown the lag distribution for the four principal pair-types.\\
VTA dopaminergic neurons were laser tagged in first place, we can use the laser tagged units as control to validate the dopaminergic neurons classification; in fig.\ref{fig:LagInSecLaser} is shown the lag distribution of laser tagged dopaminergic units coupled with SPN and FSN. We can observe the similarity between the lag distribution of pairs containing laser tagged dopaminergic units and the lag distribution of the pairs containing classified dopaminergic units, in fact SPN-laser DAN pairs show directionality in direction $VS\rightarrow VTA$, whereas FSN-laser DAN are not directional, as we expected from the results obtained using classified units, which confirms the validity of the adopted classification.\\

\label{fig:LagInSecLaser}
\end{figure}
The kind of activation exhibited by a directional pair is exemplified for an inter-regional directional pair in fig.\ref{fig:directional_assembly}. The pair in example was detected with a bin width of $\Delta = 0.12$, and the inter-units activation lag was positive with value 0.36 $sec$. On top is shown the mean across trials of the pair's activity for rewarded (grey line) and unrewarded odor (purple line) in the original phase, from the difference between the two activation lines, we say the illustrated pair specifically code for rewarded odor. On bottom are shown raster plot and mean firing rate of units in assembly. x-axis origin corresponds to the odour onset, while the red line marks the end of the stimulus duration.
Looking at the activity of two neurons, the directionality exemplified by the pair is evident, in fact we see first the VS unit becoming active and, after a temporal delay, the activation of VTA unit following. Raster plots show the stability of the activity across trials.\\

On bottom raster plot and firing rate (mean and standard deviation) of units in assembly. x-axis origin corresponds to the odor onset, while the red line marks the end of the stimulus duration. The examined assembly has a positive lag, that means VS preceding in activity VTA, from neuronal activity we can see in fact the VS unit activate before than the VTA unit.}
    \label{fig:directional_assembly}
\end{figure}
At the end of the temporal scales and directionality investigation, we make the hypothesis that the time scale segregation reveals different assembly-activation patterns, as one can see from an example of activation pattern segregation in fig.\ref{fig:AsActBinLag}, where we show the heat map of inter-regional pairs activity averaged across trials in one of the paradigms of the experiment.\\Pairs exhibiting directionality $VS \rightarrow VTA$ and detected in the precise time scale ($\Delta \le 0.25$) became activated early during the odour presentation, a good portion of them show a second activation after the odour presentation.\\The early activation at the stimulus presentation is the type of activation we expect when the animal predicts the reward, as discussed in \hyperref[sec:StateArt]{Section~\ref*{sec:StateArt}}, moreover we have shown in fig.\ref{fig:LagInSec4typo} as the SPN-DAN pairs are directional, thus we speculate that SPN-DAN are good candidate for reward prediction (RP) coding; the investigation of this hypothesis will be argument of the next chapters.\\

\end{figure}
\section{Conclusion}
From the inter-regional time scales distribution we deduced VS-VTA pairs have two time scales of interaction, which highlights the complexity of VS-VTA pair interactions and underlines the importance to choose a method capable to explore different time scales.\\The two time scales involved in VS-VTA interaction were then separated to continue the study with the lag analysis, from which emerged a preferred directionality in the verse $VS\rightarrow VTA$ in pairs containing striatal projection neurons and dopamaninergic neurons.\\The study of bin widths and lags of pairs depicted differences among different time scales of interaction and directionalities. We assume a segregation in activation patterns derived from time scales and directionality segregation; in that direction, as preliminary investigation, we have shown in a small portion of the data-set that, pairs detected at the precise time scale and exhibiting the directionality $VS\rightarrow VTA$ show an activity pattern in agreement with the reward prediction coding.\\Since directional assemblies are formed by striatal projection neurons and dopaminergic neurons, we hypothesize that those pairs are good candidate for prediction error coding. This question will be the \textit{fil rouge} of the next chapter, in other words we ask whether different pair-types have different coding feature. The starting point of the analysis is the pair-types task related response. A systematic analysis of this is performed in \hyperref[sec:TaskResp]{Section~\ref*{sec:TaskResp}}.

 \section{Pair-types task-related pattern}
 \label{sec:TaskResp}
In the previous section we conclude that time scale segregation and directionality might reflect specific task-related coding feature, using an example we have shown how different directionality reveal different pairs activity patterns. We have seen as well that different assembly-pairs have different directionality distribution and SPN-DAN assembly-pairs, in particular, exhibit a clear $VS\rightarrow VTA$ directionality.\\Thus in this section we investigate if different assembly-pairs-types have different task-related activity patterns, which express different task-related feature coding.\\
We tested the responsiveness of each assembly-pair to the conditioned stimulus (CS $+/-$) and the unconditioned stimulus (US), through an analysis of variance performed using a paired Friedman's test on the trial by trial assembly-pair activity in the different windows. The time intervals were 0.5 $sec$ long, they were chosen as follow: CS $+/-$ interval satisfied the condition $t \in [0, 0.5]$ $sec$ considering as starting point the odor onset, CS$+/-$cont. was the window including each time $t$ satisfying $t \in [-0.5, 0]$ $sec$ before the reward retrieval, in which the the odor was still present, US interval included times $t \in [0,0.5]$ from the reward delivery, in addition we considered as baseline the interval $t \in [-0.8, -0.3]$ $sec$ before the odor onset. For each trial the baseline interval was a time window of 0.5 $sec$ long, before the odor onset when no external stimuli were present, in which no task related activity could have interfered with the spontaneous neural activity. As shown by an example of the neural activity averaged across trials in fig.\ref{fig:Baseline} during the baseline period no activity pattern emerges besides the spontaneous neural activity.\\
Analysis of variance compares the means of several groups to test the hypothesis that they are all equal, against the general alternative that they are not all equal. This alternative was in our case too general. Hence, in the cases in which we obtained an omnibus significant $\chi^2$ test, the post-hoc procedure were designed using the matlab function $\textit{multcompare}$ whose critical values where computed with Bonferroni method.\\
In fig.\ref{fig:SPN_Ex} two examples of assembly-pairs resulting significant for Friedman's test made on hit trials (correct trials for rewarded odor).\\On top a SPN+DAN pair, for which the post-hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between the baseline and the CS+ cont. groups. Interestingly we observe, in CS+ cont. window, less assembly-activity in the first trials and intense assembly-activity in the last trials, the same trend is observed in CS+ window for FSN+DAN pair example fig.\ref{fig:SPN_Ex}, while the opposite trend is observed for the same pair during the reward retrieval (US window).\\In the first trials we assume that the mouse lives an explorative period in which the rule of task has not been learnt, while it has been at the end of the original phase. In other words in the first part of the task the animal is almost always surprised when the reward is delivered, while during the second part of the original phase then the mouse is able to predict the reward during the stimulus presentation, at the reward time instead.\\ According to this assumption and not debated considerations in literature about Ventral Striatum and dopaminergic neurons activity related to the expectation of reward (\cite{Schultz1992} \cite{Schultz} \cite{Fiorillo}), if the assembly-pair code for reward prediction, then the activity will be intense during the presentation of the rewarded stimulus only in the last part of the task-phase as is shown in the CS+cont. window for first example of fig.\ref{fig:SPN_Ex} (top), and in CS+ window for the second example (bottom). If the assembly-pair is coding for reward prediction error then in the reward window (US) we would expect intense activity related to the surprise to have the reward in the first part of the task, and less activation when the animal acquired sureness about the reward as is shown in the FSN-DAN pair activity.\\

A good portion of assembly-pairs exhibited a significant task related pattern activity, the number in percentage of those belonging to the four principal pair-types,is shown in fig.\ref{fig:PercAsFried}. The histograms refer to the Friedman tests made on hit trials, in original and reversal phase separetely.\\For each assembly-pair type we performed a large number of statistical tests, some will have p-values less than $0.05$ purely by chance, even if all null hypotheses of the family of tests performed are really true. Hence, to take this in account, the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison was applied. Bonferroni correction is the classical approach to take in account the multiple comparison problem and consists in having a control on the familywise error rate ($\alpha=0.05$). This is possible by setting the critical value $\alpha$ for an individual test at lower value than 0.05, in such a way that if all the null hypotheses are true, the probability that the family of tests includes one or more false positives due to chance is 0.05. The value $\alpha$ for an individual test is obtained by dividing the familywise error rate by the number of tests.\\

Assembly-pairs patterns of significant assemblies were plotted, and differences in assembly-types emerged. In fig.\ref{fig:HeatPairsDan} assembly-pairs tested with Friedman test and resulting to have significant task related response in original phase. In order: A1. SPN-DAN assembly-pairs in original phase: a good portion of those pairs became active early at the rewarded stimulus (CS+) presentation, a good portion remains active during the stimulus presentation (CS+ cont.), until the reward retrieval (US), only a small fraction is active only in US window, this kind of answer makes those assembly-pair-types good candidate for Reward Prediction (RP) coding. In A.2 the same assembly-pairs in the reversal phase. FSN-DAN assembly-pairs on contrast have a phasic response to the rewarded stimulus (CS+) and reward retrival (US) (B.1); in B.2 same FSN-DAN pairs in the reversal phase, a good portion of units responsive to CS+ in original phase, became in reversal responsive to US. This kind of answer makes those assembly-pair-types good candidate for Reward Prediction Error (RPE) coding.\\Those consideration will be discuss in detail in \hyperref[sec:CorrRL]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:CorrRL}}, \hyperref[sec:Regression]{Chapter~\ref*{sec:Regression}}.\\From fig.\ref{fig:HeatPairsDan} and fig.\ref{fig:HeatPairsGaba} we have seen that different assembly-types are active in different task moments, summary plots are shown in fig. \ref{fig:FriedHistoDAN} and fig.\ref{fig:FriedHistoGABA} where are shown histograms of percentage number of significant assembly-pair types activated in different moments and phases of the task.\\The first remarkable difference is between the original and reversal phase. In reversal phase for all pair-types we notice less activation in CS window with respect to the original phase.

 %First difference between original and reversal phase is number of assemblies responding during the post-stimulus interval, this number decrease for all the typologies involved during hit trials (as shown in fig. (\ref{fig:histo_taskrel})), in according to the intuition, in reversal phase in fact, when the animals became more expert, neuronal response tend to be shifted closer to the reward delivery. This effect can be seen in fig. (\ref{fig:NeusInAsse}) where activity and raster plots of two units in a pair are shown. Looking at the raster plots, a shift in correspondence to the phase-switch is evident in both units.

%%%%% Commento Utile
%To better study assemblies activation patterns, first the task relevant moments of the experiment were selected. From the mean task related activity patterns we expected to see differences among assemblies types in two experimental chapters (original and reversal). To better visualize the task related activation patterns via heat plots, hit trials (rewarded odor, mouse went for reward), correct rejection trials (unrewarded odor, mouse sat quiet), false alarm trials (unrewarded odor, mouse went for reward), were kept separated; however this separation among trials types was released in further analysis, without affecting results.
%The assemblies were pruned according their significant task related activity, that was tested with Friedman's test and a non parametric version of the repeated measures Anova. We preferred to use non-parametric tests to be free from the assumption of gaussianity of the observations. Results of the two tests were consistent each other. The two relevant events of the task were the odor onset and the reward delivery, then we choose whether the assemblies showed a significant activity in three windows: Stimulus [0s, 0.5s], Pre-Reward [-0.5s, 0s], Reward [0s, 05s], the baseline was chosen in the interval [-1s, -0.5s] from the odor onset. Post-hoc analysis were performed using the Bonferroni's criterion {\color{red}check whether the criterion was Bonferroni of some other}. Almost $80\%$ of the VS-VTA assemblies showed a task related activity significant different from the baseline or from another of the windows considered. Of the significant assemblies $\%$ were composed by MSN-Type I units, $\%$ by FSI low-Type I, $\%$ by FSI high-Type I, $\%$ MSN-Type II, $\%$ by FSI low-Type II, $\%$ by FSI high-Type II, the other possible units combinations constitutes a minority and all toghether were the $\%$ {\color{red} Insert numbers of percentage}.
